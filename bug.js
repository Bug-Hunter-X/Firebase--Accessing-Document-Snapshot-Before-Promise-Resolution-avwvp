The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the promise resolves. This often happens when you are working with asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from the Firestore database.  For example, if you try to access data from a document snapshot immediately after calling `getDoc()`, the data may not yet be available. This can lead to unexpected errors, such as `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning`.
